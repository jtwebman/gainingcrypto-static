# The 4 steps:

1. Acquire Bitcoin. [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/542261ad946db70d2a000004) is the easiest way to buy it.
2. Make interest on lending out Bitcoin. [Bitconnect](https://bitconnect.co/?ref=jtwebman) is the top lending company.
3. Buy mining contracts to mine Bitcoin for you. [Genesis Mining](https://www.genesis-mining.com/a/1917491) is the leader in this space.
4. Reinvest money made from lending and mining. Compound interest is amazing!

You might be thinking it can't be that easy. It really is but you have to learn how to do each of these steps.

Now you might be thinking this is where I sell you my $5000 program on how to do this. Well you would be wrong, I am giving this all away for free. I rather see everyone win then to show on a few richer people how to do it. The only thing I ask is that you do good things with your life.

Here is a little more information on the 4 steps.

# Step 1 - Acquire Bitcoin

The easiest way it to purchase bitcoin using an exchange. I use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/542261ad946db70d2a000004) as it is the easiest to use but it might not work in your country. If that is the case you can google `how to buy bitcoin in (your country)`.

Now you might be saying what if I have no money to buy any. Well then I would say it is time to take a serous look at your finances and what you are spending money on. Investing is risky and should only be done with money that isn't going towards your basic needs. I say this out of love as I have been where you are. I started out with $100 a month by eating out less. It is amazing how fast those things add up.

When you have your budget setup better and can start investing money monthly then you can continue on to step 2.

# Step 2 - Make interest on lending out Bitcoin

Once you have a little over $100 in Bitcoin you can start to lend it out. One of the sites that lets you do this is [Bitconnect](https://bitconnect.co/?ref=jtwebman).

What you do next is send your Bitcoin to your wallet on [Bitconnect](https://bitconnect.co/?ref=jtwebman) and then you trade Bitcoin for [Bitconnect](https://bitconnect.co/?ref=jtwebman) coins on their exchange.

After that you lend those coins to them for a set amount of time and they pay you interest on the dollar amount you invest each day. Each day that amount is different but today the average amount over the last 6 months is a little under 1% a day.

Yes you read that correctly. They pay almost 1% a day. They are using a bot that trades volatility in the cryptocurrency space. They then take a portion of what they make and pay you in interest. Yes you could learn to trade and then go build your own bot to trade for you but to make what they are making is going to take you making a bunch of mistakes first as well as a big pot of cash to have enough capital to make it worth the fees.

Now that you are lending you can now take the interest you make and start re-investing it into lending every time you get to $10 in your lending wallet. This is the compounding effect. As you keep doing this your daily interest payments will keep getting bigger and bigger.

If you put nothing more in and just keep re-investing each time you have $10 you would have over $3000 invest after just one year and would be making around $30 a day from the investment. The thing is you want to grow it faster. So each month keep buying more Bitcoin and then lend it out.

# Step 3 - Buy mining contracts to mine Bitcoin for you

Once you have your [Bitconnect](https://bitconnect.co/?ref=jtwebman) account making you a few $100 a day signup at [Genesis Mining](https://www.genesis-mining.com/a/1917491) and start to look into buying mining contracts to mine coin for you.

The reason you wait is because mining contracts don't pay as well as lending. Also you don't get the capital back like you do with [Bitconnect](https://bitconnect.co/?ref=jtwebman). What you want is a way to start diversifying your holding but still make passive income.

What you make in mining is very depended on how hard it is to find a block and what the price of currency you are mining at the time. I plan on making a video showing this as well as how to know if it is worth it.

# Step 4 - Reinvest

Just keep reinvesting the money.

If you want you can look for a few other lending platforms to keep things even more diverse. If you do use other lending platforms make sure you do your research. They are not all created equally.

# Made It

You made it. You are now making more then $1000 a day from your investments. At this point you probably can quit your job and start taking out some of this to pay your bills and buy food. Just make sure you are still investing money. Nothing is forever. You also might want to start taking some of the money and investing into other assets like real estate, gold and silver, or the stock market. I like to make it a game. Each day wake up and see how much more I can invest each day.  

# Things to Avoid

## ICO - Initial Coin Offerings

Currently this is going crazy. There is a new coin almost daily now it seems like. The issue is they are extremely risky. They can run off with your money and leave you with a worthless coin. Even if they do pay off it can take 6+ months sometimes before you can even trade the coin and most of the time that is in their own exchange. So you are at their whim. Be careful!
