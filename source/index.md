# The 4 steps:

1. Acquire Bitcoin and hold it. [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/542261ad946db70d2a000004) is the easiest way to buy it.
2. Buy mining contracts to mine Bitcoin for you. [Hashflare](https://hashflare.io/r/FE1432FC) and [Genesis Mining](https://www.genesis-mining.com/a/1917491) are the leaders in this space.
3. Make interest on lending out Bitcoin. [Devor](https://davor.io/?r=06FE99) and [Bitconnect](https://bitconnect.co/?ref=jtwebman) are the top lending companies.
4. Reinvest money made from mining and lending. Compound interest is amazing!

You might be thinking it can't be that easy. It really is but you have to learn how to do each of these steps.

Now you might be thinking this is where I sell you my $5000 program on how to do this. Well you would be wrong, I am giving this all away for free. I rather see everyone win then to show on a few richer people how to do it. The only thing I ask is that you do good things with your life.

# What is Bitcoin

Now that you know what Bitcoin is and a little about them lets start on how to get some.

# Step 1 - Acquire Bitcoin

The easiest way it to purchase bitcoin using an exchange. I use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/542261ad946db70d2a000004) as it is the easiest to use but it might not work in your country. If that is the case you can google `how to buy bitcoin in (your country)`.

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/542261ad946db70d2a000004) is going to ask things like address and make you prove you are who you say you are by sending pictures of your drivers license or passport. This is just like any other exchange in the stock market. Once you are setup you can now link your bank accounts as well as credit cards to the exchange and for a small fee start buying Bitcoin.

This is one of the least risky ways and is just like buying stocks. The only difference is you don't have to buy 1 bitcoin. You can by fractions of a bitcoin. The downside to just buying and holding as you only make money when you sell but I still think you should hold some bitcoin even if you do the steps below.

# Step 2 - Buy mining contracts to mine Bitcoin for you

Now that you have some bitcoin it is time to start thinking about expanding on that coin by investing into some cloud mining. These sites let you lease bitcoin mining rigs from them and to mine bitcoin.

You might be asking what is mining? ere is a good video talking about it.

Here are the two sites I buy mining contracts on [Hashflare](https://hashflare.io/r/FE1432FC) and [Genesis Mining](https://www.genesis-mining.com/a/1917491). Genesis mining is currently out of Bitcoin contracts but [Hashflare](https://hashflare.io/r/FE1432FC) still has 1 year contracts. How it works is you purchase some mining power at $2.20 per 10 GHs (Gigahash a second) for the 1 year. There are calculators out there that can help you figure out how profitable it is currently. What you make in mining is very depended on how hard it is to find a block and what the price of currency you are mining at the time.

Here is a video I made taking about the basics of [Hashflare](https://hashflare.io/r/FE1432FC):

# Step 3 - Make interest on lending out Bitcoin

Once you having your mining contracts going and are reinvesting daily in those the next thing to get start is lending on [Bitconnect](https://bitconnect.co/?ref=jtwebman).

I am planning on making a video but the basics is you have to transfer Bitcoin to your wallet on [Bitconnect](https://bitconnect.co/?ref=jtwebman) and then you trade Bitcoin for [Bitconnect](https://bitconnect.co/?ref=jtwebman) coins on their exchange.

[Devor](https://davor.io/?r=06FE99) is a another program that works the same way. It has just started as well so you can get in on the ground floor.

After that you lend those coins to them for a set amount of time and they pay you interest on the dollar amount you invest each day. Each day that amount is different but today the average amount over the last 6 months is a little under 1% a day.

Yes you read that correctly. They pay almost 1% a day. They are using a bot that trades volatility in the cryptocurrency space. They then take a portion of what they make and pay you in interest. Yes you could learn to trade and then go build your own bot to trade for you but to make what they are making is going to take you making a bunch of mistakes first as well as a big pot of cash to have enough capital to make it worth the fees.

Just like with mining you want to keep reinvesting your earnings. Now these programs are more risky then buying mining contracts so you might want to reinvest for about 60 days and then at least pull out your initial investment. This would then take away all your risk.

# Step 4 - Reinvest

Just keep reinvesting the money. Compound interest is your friend!

# Made It

You made it. You are now making more then $1000 a day from your investments. At this point you probably can quit your job and start taking out some of this to pay your bills and buy food. Just make sure you are still investing money. Nothing is forever. You also might want to start taking some of the money and investing into other assets like real estate, gold and silver, or the stock market. I like to make it a game. Each day wake up and see how much more I can invest each day.  

# Other ways to invest in cryptocurrency

## ICO - Initial Coin Offerings

Currently this is going crazy. There is a new coin almost daily now it seems like. The issue is they are extremely risky. They can run off with your money and leave you with a worthless coin. Even if they do pay off it can take 6+ months sometimes before you can even trade the coin and most of the time that is in their own exchange. So you are at their whim. Be careful! Also depending on the coin they might not even be legal for you to invest in them if you are in the US. Be very careful here.

## Alt coins

You can looks at charts and start purchasing other coins with the hope that they will go up. Be careful here as well. There are many people on the internet that like to pump coins and then when a bunch of people have bought in will sell their position and they will drop. It is not uncommon to see 100% returns in a day and then a few days later see it drop 80%.
